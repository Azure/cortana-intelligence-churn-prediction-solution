# Retail Customer Churn Prediction - A Cortana Intelligence Solution How-to Guide

Keeping existing customers is five times cheaper than the cost of attaining new ones.[1] For this reason, marketing executives often find themselves trying to estimate the likelihood of customer
churn and finding the necessary actions to minimize the churn rate. 

Customer Churn Prediction uses Azure Machine Learning to predict churn probability and helps find patterns in existing data associated with the
predicted churn rate. This information empowers businesses with actionable intelligence to improve customer retention and profit margins.
