## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate predictive data pipelines for retailer to predict customer churn.  By combining domain knowledge and predictive analytics, retailers can prevent customer churn by using the predictive result and proper marketing strategies.  It also shows  how retraining of a model works.

The end-to-end solution is implemented in the cloud, using Microsoft Azure. The solution is composed of several Azure components, including data ingest, data storage, data movement, advanced analytics and visualization. The advanced analytics is featured with Azure Machine Learning where you can use Python or R language to  build data science model and also reuse existing in-house or third-party libraries.  With data ingest, the solution can make prediction based on the data that moves in to azure from on-premises environment.

This deployment guide will guide you through the process of creating such a customer churn prediction solution. The tutorial will include:

- The generation and ingestion of purchase transaction data using  Azure Event Hub and Azure Streaming Analytics.
- The creation of an Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW) to store large amount of transaction records in real time
- Use of PolyBase to load on-premises data to Azure SQL DW
- Using Azure Machine Learning (AML) to deploy prediction model as web services and run periodic prediction in Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Dashboard to display sales and customer churn data
- Retaining of the machine learning model with new data

## Prerequisites

The steps described later in this guide  require the
following prerequisites:

1)  Azure subscription with login credentials
    (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

2)  Azure Machine learning Studio subscription
    (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)

3)  A Microsoft Power BI account
    (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)

4)  Power BI Desktop installation
    (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/?gated=0&number=0)

5)  A local installation of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-install-visual-studio/">Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)</a>


##Architecture


Figure 1 illustrates the Azure architecture developed in this sample.

![](media/architecture.png)
Figure 1: Architecture

The above figure is the implemented architecture. The historical data as text format will be loaded from Azure Blob Storage into Azure SQL DW though PolyBase.  The real-time event data will be ingested through Event Hub into Azure.  Azure Stream Analytics will store the data in Azure SQL DW. The prediction through AML runs in batch mode and is invoked by Azure Data Factory. AML will import data from Azure SQL DW and output the prediction to Azure Blob Storage. Through PolyBase, the prediction result can be loaded into Azure SQL DW efficiently and fast. Azure SQL DW serves the queries to populate the PowerBI dashboard. We use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate
1) AML prediction
2) Copy the prediction from Azure Blob Storage to  Azure SQL DW.

The machine learning model here is used as an example experiment and it shows the general techniques of data science that can be used in customer churn prediction. You can use domain knowledge and combine the available datasets to build more advanced model to meet your business requirements.

 For the nature of the problem, customer behavior changes slowly and doesnâ€™t require real-time or near real-time prediction in minute scale. Therefore, we use AML in batch mode.  We use Azure SQL DW for its scalability to query large amount of data, and its elasticity of starting small and scaling up as needed easily.  We chose to use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL DW because of its high efficiency.


##Setup Steps

The following are the steps to deploy the end-to-end solution for the predictive pipelines.

### Instruction for Finding Resource Groups

Going back to your resource group is important over the course of deployment steps. Here is the how we can find the desired resource group:

 1. Log into the Azure Management Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com
 1. Click  **Resource groups** button on upper left
 1. Choose the subscription your resource group resides in
 1. Use keywords to search or directly select your resource group in the list of resource groups
 1. You need to close the resource description page to add new resources



### Unique String

 You will need a unique string to identify your deployment because some Azure services, e.g. Azure Storage requires a unique name for each instance across the service. We suggest you use only letters and numbers in this string and the length should not be greater than 9.
 We suggest you use "[UI]churn[N]"  where [UI] is the user's initials,  N is a random integer that you choose and characters must be entered in in lowercase. Please open your memo file and write down "unique:[unique]" with "[unique]" replaced with your actual unique string.

### Create an Azure Resource Group

1. Log into the Azure Management Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com
1. Click  **Resource groups** button on upper left, and then click **+** to add a resource group.

If you reach here, you have a working solution that runs the customer churn prediction. Over the time, you might have accumulate customer transaction data that display a different buying behavior and therefore you need to retrain your model. The following steps show you how to set up a retrain pipeline which updates the model with new data every 1 hour.

## Retain

### Deploy Training Machine Learning Web Service
1. Go to https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Retail-Churn-Train-1
2. Click ***Open in Studio*** on the right. Login as needed.
3. Choose the region and workspace. For region, you should choose the region that your resource group resides. For workspace, you should choose the workspace with the name the same as your unique string.
4. Wait until the experiment is copied
5. Input database information in the two **Import Data** modules. You only need to change "Database server name", "Database name", "User name" and "Password". Use the information you collected in the "Azure SQL Data Warehouse" table. Leave the query as it is.
6. Click **Run** at the bottom of the page. It takes around three minutes to run the experiment.
7. Click **Deploy Web Service** at the bottom of the page, choose classic web service, and click "Yes" to publish the web service. This will lead you to the web service page. The web service home page can also be found by clicking the WEB SERVICES button on the left menu once logged in your workspace.
8. Copy the API key from the web service home page and save it to your memo
9. Click the link ***BATCH EXECUTION*** under the ***API HELP PAGE section***. On the BATCH EXECUTION help page, copy the Request URI under the Request section and add it to the table below as you will need this information later . Copy only the URI part https:â€¦ /jobs, ignoring the URI parameters starting with ? .

  | **Train Machine learning Web Service** |                           |
  | --------------------------- |--------------------------|
  | apiKey                     | [API key from API help page]|
  | mlEndpint              |        [Batch Request URI]                   ||


### Create Updatable Predictive Machine Learning Web Service
The default web service endpoint we deployed in the section of "Deploy Azure Machine Learning Predictive Web Service" is associated with the experiment itself. In order to have a updatable endpoint, we need to create an additional service endpoint.

1. Go to https://studio.azureml.net, and choose workspace with the name of your unique string. You can change the workspace by clicking drop-down list on the top right of the web page.
2. On the left side, choose **Web Service** and click the service that you deployed in the section "Deploy Azure Machine Learning Predictive Web Service" with name "Retail Churn [Predictive Exp.]"
3. Click ***Manage endpoints*** at the bottom of the page in the "Additional endpoints" section.
4. On the newly loaded page, click **+New**,
    1. Enter **update** for "Name"
    2. Leave everything else as default
    3. Click **Save**
5. After the endpoint is created, click the "update" service endpoint
    1. click ***Use endpoint*** under the **BASICS** picture, save to the memo the "**Primary key**", "**Batch requests**" (only need to copy up to "jobs") and also "**Patch**"
    2. Click ***API help*** under ***Patch*** URI, in the new page, save to the memo the **Resource Name** in the ***Updatable Resources*** section. It starts with "Retail Churn Template". This will be used in Azure Data Factory pipeline to update the model. An example can be found in ([AzureMLLinkedService.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedService.json)).

    | **Updatable Predictive Machine Learning Web Service** |                           |
    | --------------------------- |--------------------------:|
    | apiKey                     | [Primary Key]|
    | mlEndpint              |        [Batch Request URI]                   |
    | updateResourceEndpoint |   [Patch URI]|
    | trainedModelName | [Resource Name]|

### Create Azure Data Factory For Retraining and Updating
1. Go to Azure Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com and choose the resource group you just deployed
2. Click the data factory you created in this solution
3. Click ***Author and deploy***
3. Stop MLPipeline:
    1.  Click **MLPipeline** in the "Pipelines" list,
    2.  Start the pipeline by setting the value "isPaused" to "true"
    ```
    "isPaused": true
    ```
    3.  Click the upper arrow button to  deploy it
4. Create/Update Linked services:
    1. Click **New Compute**, choose ***Azure ML***,  replay the content in the editor with  the content in [AzureMLLinkedServiceTraining.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedServiceTraining.json), replace  the content in "mlEndpoint" and "apikey" with  the real value in the "Train Machine learning Web Service" section of your memo , and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it. You can check the value from your memo in the Azure Machine learning Web service part.
    2. Click **AzureMLLinkedService**, remove the content in the editor, copy  the content in [AzureMLLinkedService.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedService.json) in the retrain folder  to the editor, replace  the content in "mlEndpoint" , "apikey" and "updateResourceEndpoint" with  the real value in the "Updatable Predictive Machine learning Web Service" section of your memo , and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it.
5. Create datasets
    1.  Click **New Dataset**, choose ***Azure Blob Storage***, replace the content in the editor with the content in [TrainedModelBlob.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/TrainedModelBlob.json) to the editor, and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it
    1.  Click **New Dataset**, choose ***Azure SQL Data Warehouse***, replace the content in the editor with the content in [AzureSqlDWInputUserRetrain.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureSqlDWInputUserRetrain.json) to the editor, and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it

        2. Replace "[unique]" with your unique string (two instances of ""[unique]""),  "[User]" and "[password]" with their real value in this solution
        3. Specify an active period that you want the pipeline to run.  Since the data passing through in 15 minutes represents a day's data, and  we have 60 days data in total, we needed only 15-hour period for the pipeline. You should use the current UTC time as the starttime. An example is like:
        ```
        "start": "2016-12-01T00:00:00Z",
        "end": "2016-12-01T15:00:00Z",
