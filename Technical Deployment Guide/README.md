## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate predictive data pipelines for retailers to predict customer churn.  Retailers can use these predictions to prevent customer churn by using their domain knowledge and proper marketing strategies to address at-risk customers. This tutorial also shows how customer churn models can be retrained to leverage additional data as it becomes available.

The end-to-end solution is implemented in the cloud, using Microsoft Azure. The solution is composed of several Azure components, including data ingest, data storage, data movement, advanced analytics and visualization. The advanced analytics are implemented in Azure Machine Learning Studio, where one can use Python or R language to build data science models (or reuse existing in-house or third-party libraries).  With data ingest, the solution can make predictions based on data that being transferred to Azure from an on-premises environment.

This deployment guide will walk you through the steps of creating a customer churn prediction solution, including:

- Generation and ingestion of purchase transaction data using Azure Event Hub and Azure Streaming Analytics
- Creation of an Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW) to store large volumes of transaction records in real time
- Use of PolyBase to transfer on-premises data to Azure SQL DW
- Use of Azure Machine Learning (AML) to deploy predictive models as web services and schedule periodic predictions via Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Creation of a dashboard to display sales and customer churn data
- Retraining of the machine learning model with new data

## Prerequisites

The steps described later in this guide require the following prerequisites:

1)  An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with login credentials
2)  A free [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) subscription
3)  A [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) account
4)  An installed copy of [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/?gated=0&number=0)
5)  A local installation of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-install-visual-studio/">Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)</a>

## Architecture

Figure 1 illustrates the Azure architecture that we will create.

Figure 1: Architecture

The historical data (in text format) will be loaded from Azure Blob Storage into Azure SQL DW though PolyBase.  The real-time event data will be ingested into Azure through Event Hub into Azure; Azure Stream Analytics will then store the data in Azure SQL DW. Predictions from Azure Machine Learning models are performed in batches invoked by Azure Data Factory. AML will import data from Azure SQL DW and output the predictions to Azure Blob Storage. Through PolyBase, the prediction result can be loaded into Azure SQL DW quickly and efficiently. Azure SQL DW will serve the queries to populate the PowerBI dashboard. We will use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate:
1) Generating the AML predictions, and 
2) Copying the predictions from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL DW.

The machine learning model used here shows the general techniques of data science that can be used in customer churn prediction. You can use domain knowledge and combine the available datasets to build more advanced models to meet your business requirements.

Customer behavior changes slowly and doesnâ€™t require real-time or near real-time prediction. Therefore, we use AML in batch mode.  We use Azure SQL DW for its scalability to query large databases, and its elasticity for easy scaling as needed.  We chose to use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL DW because of its high efficiency.

## Setup Steps

The following are the steps to deploy the end-to-end solution for the predictive pipelines.

### Unique String

You will need a unique string to identify your deployment because some Azure services, e.g. Azure Storage requires a unique name for each instance across the service. We suggest you use only letters and numbers in this string and the length should not be greater than 9.
 
We suggest you use "[UI]churn[N]"  where [UI] is the user's initials,  N is a random integer that you choose and characters must be entered in in lowercase. Please open your memo file and write down "unique:[unique]" with "[unique]" replaced with your actual unique string.

### Create an Azure Resource Group

1. Log into the [Azure Management Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Resource groups** button on upper left, and then click **+** button to add a resource group.
1. Enter your **unique string** for the resource group and choose your subscription.
1. For **Resource Group Location**, you should choose one of the following as they are the locations that support all the Azure services used in this guide:
  - South Central US
  - West Europe
  - Southeast Asia

Please open your memo file and save the information in the form of the following table. Please replace the content in [] with its actual value.  

| **Azure Resource Group** |                     |

Power BI is used to create visualizations for monitoring sales and predictions. It can also be used to help detect trend in important factors for predicting churn. The instructions that follow describe how you can use the provided Power BI desktop file (Customer-Churn-Report.pbix) to visualize your data. 

- Download [Power BI Desktop application](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop) and install it.
- Download the Power BI template file Customer-Churn-Report.pbix by left-clicking on the file and clicking on "Download" on the page that follows.
- Double click the downloaded ".pbix" file and it will be opened in Power BI Desktop.
- The template file connects to a database used in development. You'll need to change some parameters so that it links to your own database. To do this, follow these steps:
	- Click on "Edit Queries" as shown in the following figure. 
[![Figure 1][pic 1]][pic 1] 

	- Select a Query from the Queries panel (e.g., Age) and click on "Advanced Editors" as shown in the following figure.
[![Figure 2][pic 2]][pic 2] 

	- In the pop-up window for Advanced Editor, replace all values "dbchurn" with the name of your database, as shown in the following two figures which assumes that the name of the new database is "mydb." You should use the of name your own database. Click "Done" after making the changes.

	- Update the other Queries by replacing "dbchurn" with the name of your database. 
	- Click on the "Close & Apply" ribbon after all Queries have been updated. You should now see multiple tabs in Power BI Desktop's report page. The "MyDashboard" tab combines the content from the "Activities" and "Predictions" tabs. The "Features" tab look at the important variables for predicting churn: days between transactions, region, and number of transactions.

Now we can publish the report into Power BI online to allow easy sharing with others. Following the following steps to accomplish this: 
 
- Click on "Publish" as shown below. Sign in with your Power BI credentials and choose a destination (e.g., My Workspace). 
[![Figure 7][pic 7]][pic 7]

If you reach here, you have a working solution that runs the customer churn prediction. Over the time, you might have accumulate customer transaction data that display a different buying behavior and therefore you need to retrain your model. The following steps show you how to set up a retrain pipeline which updates the model with new data every 1 hour.

## Retrain

### Deploy Training Machine Learning Web Service
1. Go to https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Retail-Churn-Train-1
2. Click ***Open in Studio*** on the right. Login as needed.
3. Choose the region and workspace. For region, you should choose the region that your resource group resides. For workspace, you should choose the workspace with the name the same as your unique string.
4. Wait until the experiment is copied
5. Input database information in the two **Import Data** modules. You only need to change "Database server name", "Database name", "User name" and "Password". Use the information you collected in the "Azure SQL Data Warehouse" table. Leave the query as it is.
6. Click **Run** at the bottom of the page. It takes around three minutes to run the experiment.
7. Click **Deploy Web Service** at the bottom of the page, choose classic web service, and click "Yes" to publish the web service. This will lead you to the web service page. The web service home page can also be found by clicking the WEB SERVICES button on the left menu once logged in your workspace.
8. Copy the API key from the web service home page and save it to your memo
9. Click the link ***BATCH EXECUTION*** under the ***API HELP PAGE section***. On the BATCH EXECUTION help page, copy the Request URI under the Request section and add it to the table below as you will need this information later . Copy only the URI part https:â€¦ /jobs, ignoring the URI parameters starting with ? .

  | **Train Machine learning Web Service** |                           |
  | --------------------------- |--------------------------|
  | apiKey                     | [API key from API help page]|
  | mlEndpint              |        [Batch Request URI]                   ||


### Create Updatable Predictive Machine Learning Web Service
The default web service endpoint we deployed in the section of "Deploy Azure Machine Learning Predictive Web Service" is associated with the experiment itself. In order to have a updatable endpoint, we need to create an additional service endpoint.

1. Go to https://studio.azureml.net, and choose workspace with the name of your unique string. You can change the workspace by clicking drop-down list on the top right of the web page.
2. On the left side, choose **Web Service** and click the service that you deployed in the section "Deploy Azure Machine Learning Predictive Web Service" with name "Retail Churn [Predictive Exp.]"
3. Click ***Manage endpoints*** at the bottom of the page in the "Additional endpoints" section.
4. On the newly loaded page, click **+New**,
    1. Enter **update** for "Name"
    2. Leave everything else as default
    3. Click **Save**
5. After the endpoint is created, click the "update" service endpoint
    1. click ***Use endpoint*** under the **BASICS** picture, save to the memo the "**Primary key**", "**Batch requests**" (only need to copy up to "jobs") and also "**Patch**"
    2. Click ***API help*** under ***Patch*** URI, in the new page, save to the memo the **Resource Name** in the ***Updatable Resources*** section. It starts with "Retail Churn Template". This will be used in Azure Data Factory pipeline to update the model. An example can be found in ([AzureMLLinkedService.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedService.json)).

    | **Updatable Predictive Machine Learning Web Service** |                           |
    | --------------------------- |--------------------------:|
    | apiKey                     | [Primary Key]|
    | mlEndpint              |        [Batch Request URI]                   |
    | updateResourceEndpoint |   [Patch URI]|
    | trainedModelName | [Resource Name]|

### Create Azure Data Factory For Retraining and Updating
1. Go to Azure Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com and choose the resource group you just deployed
2. Click the data factory you created in this solution
3. Click ***Author and deploy***
3. Stop MLPipeline:
    1.  Click **MLPipeline** in the "Pipelines" list,
    2.  Start the pipeline by setting the value "isPause
    3.  d" to "true"
    ```
    "isPaused": true
    ```
    3.  Click the upper arrow button to  deploy it
4. Create/Update Linked services:
    1. Click **New Compute**, choose ***Azure ML***,  replay the content in the editor with  the content in [AzureMLLinkedServiceTraining.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedServiceTraining.json), replace  the content in "mlEndpoint" and "apikey" with  the real value in the "Train Machine learning Web Service" section of your memo , and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it. You can check the value from your memo in the Azure Machine learning Web service part.
    2. Click **AzureMLLinkedService**, remove the content in the editor, copy  the content in [AzureMLLinkedService.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureMLLinkedService.json) in the retrain folder  to the editor, replace  the content in "mlEndpoint" , "apikey" and "updateResourceEndpoint" with  the real value in the "Updatable Predictive Machine learning Web Service" section of your memo , and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it.
5. Create datasets
    1.  Click **New Dataset**, choose ***Azure Blob Storage***, replace the content in the editor with the content in [TrainedModelBlob.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/TrainedModelBlob.json) to the editor, and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it
    1.  Click **New Dataset**, choose ***Azure SQL Data Warehouse***, replace the content in the editor with the content in [AzureSqlDWInputUserRetrain.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureSqlDWInputUserRetrain.json) to the editor, and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it
    1. Click **New Dataset**, choose ***Azure SQL Data Warehouse***, replace the content in [AzureSqlDWInputActivityRetain.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/AzureSqlDWInputActivityRetrain.json) to the editor, and click the upper arrow button to  deploy it

6. Create pipelines
    1. Right click **Drafts**, choose "New pipeline",
        1. Copy the content in [RetrainPipeline.json](resource/AzureDataFactoryRetrain/RetrainPipeline.json) to the editor,
        2. Replace "[unique]" with your unique string (two instances of ""[unique]""),  "[User]" and "[password]" with their real value in this solution
        3. Specify an active period that you want the pipeline to run.  Since the data passing through in 15 minutes represents a day's data, and  we have 60 days data in total, we needed only 15-hour period for the pipeline. You should use the current UTC time as the starttime. An example is like:
        ```
        "start": "2016-12-01T00:00:00Z",
        "end": "2016-12-01T15:00:00Z",
        ```
        4.  Start the pipeline by setting the value "isPaused" to "false"
