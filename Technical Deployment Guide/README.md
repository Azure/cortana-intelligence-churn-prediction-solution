## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate predictive data pipelines for retailer to predict customer churn.  By combining domain knowledge and predictive analytics, retailers can prevent customer churn by using the predictive result and proper marketing strategies.   

The end-to-end solution is implemented in the cloud, using Microsoft Azure. The solution is composed of several Azure components, including data ingest, data storage, data movement, advanced analytics and visualization. The advanced analytics is featured with Azure Machine Learning where you can use Python or R language to  build data science model and also reuse existing in-house or third-party libraries.  With data ingest, the solution can make prediction based on the data that moves in to azure from on-premises environment.

This deployment guide will guide you through the process of creating such a customer churn prediction solution. The tutorial will include:

- The generation and ingestion of purchase transaction data using an Azure Event Hub and Azure Streaming Analytics.
- The creation of an Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW) to store large amount transaction record in real time
- Use of PolyBase to load on-premises data to Azure SQL DW
- Using Azure Machine Learning to deploy prediction model as web services and run periodic prediction in Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Dashboard to display sales and customer churn data

## Prerequisites

The steps described later in this guide  requires the
following prerequisites:

1)  Azure subscription with login credentials
    (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

2)  Azure Machine learning Studio subscription
    (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)

3)  A Microsoft Power BI account
    (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)

4)  Power BI Desktop installation
    (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/?gated=0&number=0)

5) Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer
    (http://storageexplorer.com/)

6)  A local installation of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-install-visual-studio/">Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)</a>


##Architecture


Figure 1 illustrates the Azure architecture developed in this sample.

![](media/architecture.png)
Figure 1: Architecture

The above figure is the implemented architecture. The historical data as text format will be loaded from Azure Blob Storage into Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW) though Polybase.  The real-time event data will be ingested through Event Hub into Azure.  Azure Stream Analytics will store the data in Azure SQL DW. The prediction through Azure Machine Learning (AML) runs in batch mode and is invoked by Azure Data Factory. AML will import data from Azure SQL DW and output the prediction to Azure Blob Storage. Through PolyBase, the prediction result can be loaded into Azure SQL DW efficiently and fast. Azure SQL DW serves the queries to populate the PowerBI dashboard. We use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate 1) AML prediction 2) Copy the prediction from Azure Blob Storage to  Azure SQL Data Warehouse. The machine learning model here is used as an example experiment and it shows the general techniques of data science that can be used in customer churn prediction. You can use domain knowledge and combine the available datasets to build more advanced model to meet your business requirements.

 For the nature of the problem, customer behavior changes slowly and doesnâ€™t require real-time or near real-time prediction in minute scale. Therefore, we use Azure Machine Learning in batch mode.  We use Azure SQL DW for its scalability to query large amount of data, and its elasticity of starting small and scaling up as needed easily.  We chose to use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL DW because of its high efficiency.


 ## Deployment Steps

 ### Instruction to go back to your resource group
 Going back to your resource group is important over the course of deployment steps. Here is the how we can find the desired resource group:
 1. Log into the Azure Management Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com
 1. Click  **Resource groups** button on upper left
 1. Choose the subscription your resource group resides in
 1. Use keywords to search or directly select your resource group in the list of resource groups
 1. You need to close the resource description page to add new resources

 Below are the steps to deploy the use case into your Azure subscription. Note that to condense the steps somewhat, **>** is used between repeated actions. For example:

 1. Click: **Button A**
 1. Click: **Button B**

 is written as

 1. Click: **Button A** > **Button B**  


### Unique String
 You will need a unique string to identify your deployment because some Azure services, e.g. Azure Storage requires a unique name across a region. We suggest you use only letters and numbers in this string and the length should not be greater than 9.
 We suggest you use "[UI]churn[N]"  where [UI] is the user's initials,  N is a random integer that you choose and characters must be entered in in lowercase. Please open your memo file and write down "unique:[unique]" with "[unique]" replaced with your actual unique string.

### Create an Azure Resource Group for the solution
1. Log into the Azure Management Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com
1. Click  **Resource groups** button on upper left, and then click **+** to add a resource group.
1. Enter your **unique string** for the resource group and choose your subscription.
1. For Resource Group Location you should choose one of the following as they are the locations that support all the Azure services used in this guide:
  - South Central US
  - West Europe
  - Southeast Asia

  | **Azure Resource Group** |                     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| resource group name           |[unique string]|
| region              |[region]||

Please open your memo file and write down "resource group:[unique]" with "[unique]" replaced with your actual unique string.

In the following steps, if any entry or item is not mentioned in the instruction, please leave it as the default value.

### Create Azure Storage Account
1. Go to Azure Portal https://ms.portal.azure.com and choose the resource group you just deployed

7. Leave everything else to use the default value
8. Click **Create** at the bottom. The portal may lead you back to the storage account description panel. DO NOT click "Create".
9. Go back to your resource group overview and wait until the storage account is created. To check if the resource is create or not, refresh the page or the list of the resources in the resource group as needed.

These are the steps to get the access key that will be used in the SQL script to load the data into Azure SQL DW:
10. Click the created storage account and in the new panel click **Access keys**

        3. Specify an active period that you want the pipeline to run.  Since the data passing through in 15 minutes represents a day's data, and   we have 60 days data in total, we needed only two-day period for the pipeline. An example is like:
        ```
        "start": "2016-12-01T00:00:00Z",
        "end": "2016-12-03T00:00:00Z",
        ```
        4.  start the pipeline by settint the value "isPaused" to "false"
        ```
        "isPaused": false
        ```
        4.  click the upper arrow button to  deploy it

    2. Right click **Drafts**, choose "New pipeline",
        1. copy the content in BlobToSqlDW.json to the editor,
        2. Specify an active period that you want the pipeline to run. It should be the same as the MLPipeline
        3. click the upper arrow button to  deploy it

7. When prompt with dialog windows, click "Save"

If you reach here, you have a working solution that runs the customer churn prediction. Over the time, you might have accumulate customer transaction data that display a different buying behavior and therefore you need to retrain your model. The following steps show you how to set up a retrain pipeline which updates the model with new data every 1 hour.
