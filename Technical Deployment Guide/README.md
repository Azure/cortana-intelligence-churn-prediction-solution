## Introduction

The objective of this Guide is to demonstrate predictive data pipelines for retailers to predict customer churn.  Retailers can use these predictions to prevent customer churn by applying their use-case knowhow and proper marketing strategies to address at-risk customers. This tutorial also shows how customer churn models can be retrained to leverage additional data as it becomes available.

The end-to-end solution is implemented in the cloud, using Microsoft Azure. The solution is composed of several Azure components, including data ingest, data storage, data movement, advanced analytics and visualization. The advanced analytics are implemented in Azure Machine Learning Studio, where one can use Python or R language to build data science models (or reuse existing in-house or third-party libraries).  With data ingest, the solution can make predictions based on data that is being transferred to Azure from an on-premises environment.

This deployment guide will walk you through the steps of creating a customer churn prediction solution, including:

- Generation and ingestion of purchase transaction data using Azure Event Hub and Azure Streaming Analytics
- Creation of an Azure SQL Data Warehouse (DW) to store large volumes of transaction records in real time
- Use of PolyBase to transfer on-premises data to Azure SQL DW
- Use of Azure Machine Learning (AML) to deploy predictive models as web services and schedule periodic predictions via Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Creation of a dashboard to display sales and customer churn data
- Retraining of the machine learning model with newer data

## Prerequisites

The steps described later in this guide require the following prerequisites:

1.  An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with login credentials
2.  A free [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) subscription
3.  A [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) account
4.  A local installation of [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/?gated=0&number=0)
5.  A local installation of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-data-warehouse-install-visual-studio/">Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)</a>

## Architecture

Figure 1 illustrates the solution architecture using azure services.

![Figure 1: Architecture](media/architecture.png)
Figure 1: Customer Churn Solution Architecture for Retail

The historical data (in text format) will be loaded from Azure Blob Storage into Azure SQL DW though PolyBase.  The real-time event data will be ingested through Event Hub into Azure SQL DW; Azure Stream Analytics will then store the data in Azure SQL DW. Predictions from Azure Machine Learning models are performed in batches invoked by Azure Data Factory. AML will import data from Azure SQL DW and output the predictions to Azure Blob Storage. Through PolyBase, the prediction result can be loaded into Azure SQL DW quickly and efficiently. Power BI will source data from Azure SQL DW to generate reports. We will use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate:

1. Generating the AML predictions, 
1. Copying the predictions from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL DW,
1. Retraining model, and 
1. Updating web service with the retrained model

The machine learning model used here shows the general techniques of data science that can be used in customer churn prediction. You can use domain knowledge and combine the available datasets to build more advanced models to meet your business requirements.

Customer behavior changes slowly and doesnâ€™t require real-time or near real-time prediction. Therefore, we use AML in batch mode.  We use Azure SQL DW for its scalability to query large databases, and its elasticity for easy scaling as needed.  We chose to use PolyBase to load data into Azure SQL DW because of its high efficiency.

## Setup Steps

The following are the steps to deploy the end-to-end solution for the predictive pipelines.

### Accessing Files in the Git Repository

This tutorial will refer to files available in the Technical Deployment Guide section of the [Cortana Intelligence Churn Prediction git repository](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-churn-prediction-solution). You can download all of these files at once by clicking the "Clone or download" button on the repository.

You can download or view individual files by navigating through the repository folders. If you choose this option, be sure to download the "raw" version of each file by clicking the filename to view it, then cliking Download.

### Choose a Unique String

You will need a unique string to identify your deployment because some Azure services, e.g. Azure Storage requires a unique name for each instance across the service. We suggest you use only letters and numbers in this string and the length should not be greater than 9.
 
We suggest you use "[UI]churn[N]"  where [UI] is the user's initials,  N is a random integer that you choose and characters must be entered in in lowercase. Please open your memo file and write down "unique:[unique]" with "[unique]" replaced with your actual unique string.

### Create an Azure Resource Group

1. Log into the [Azure Management Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Resource groups** button on upper left, and then click **+** button to add a resource group.
1. Enter your **unique string** for the resource group and choose your subscription.
1. For **Resource Group Location**, you should choose one of the following as they are the locations that offer all of the Azure services used in this guide (with the exception of Azure Data Factory, which need not be located in the same location):
  - South Central US
  - West Europe
  - Southeast Asia

Please open your memo file and save the information in the form of the following table. Please replace the content in [] with its actual value.  

| **Azure Resource Group** |                     |

## PowerBI Dashboard

Power BI is used to create visualizations for monitoring sales and predictions. It can also be used to help detect trends in important factors for predicting churn. The instructions that follow describe how you can use the provided Power BI desktop file (Customer-Churn-Report.pbix) to visualize your data. 

1. If you have not already done so, download and install the [Power BI Desktop application](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop).
1. Download the Power BI template file `Customer-Churn-Report.pbix` (available in the `Power BI` folder of the [git repository](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-churn-prediction-solution/tree/master/Technical%20Deployment%20Guide)) by left-clicking on the file and clicking on "Download" on the page that follows.
1. Double click the downloaded ".pbix" file to open it in Power BI Desktop.
1. The template file connects to a database used in development. You'll need to change some parameters so that it links to your own database. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. Click on "Edit Queries" as shown in the following figure.
       
        [![Figure 1][pic 1]][pic 1] 

    1. Select a Query from the Queries panel (e.g., Age) and click on "Advanced Editors" as shown in the following figure.

        [![Figure 2][pic 2]][pic 2] 

    1. In the pop-up window for Advanced Editor, replace all "dbchurn" values with your "unique string" (database and server name). This process is shown in the following two figures, which assumes that the unique string is "mydb". (You should use the name of your own database.) Click "Done" after making the changes.

        [![Figure 3][pic 3]][pic 3] 
        [![Figure 4][pic 4]][pic 4] 

    1. With the same Query (e.g., Age) selected, click on "Edit Credentials" and enter your your credentials for accessing your database (recorded in the SQL Data Warehouse memo table). Click on "Connect" as shown in the following figure.

        [![Figure 5][pic 5]][pic 5] 

    1. The data for your table should be displayed if the connection information was correct, as in the following figure.

        [![Figure 6][pic 6]][pic 6]

    1. Update the other Queries by replacing "dbchurn" with the name of your database. 
    1. Click on the "Close & Apply" ribbon after all Queries have been updated.
    
You should now see multiple tabs in Power BI Desktop's report page. The "MyDashboard" tab combines the content from the "Activities" and "Predictions" tabs. The "Features" tab displays the important variables for predicting churn: days between transactions, region, and number of transactions.

<a name="pbipublish"></a>
Now we can publish the report into Power BI online to easily share with others: 
 
1. Click on "Publish" as shown below. Sign in with your Power BI credentials and choose a destination (e.g., My Workspace). 
[![Figure 7][pic 7]][pic 7]

1. After the report is successfully published, you should see a window like the following. Click on "Got it."
[![Figure 8][pic 8]][pic 8]

1. Sign into [Power BI](www.powerbi.microsoft.com) and click on the "Customer-Churn-Report" report (under Reports) to open it. 
1. We'll share the Churn Rate Overview tab from the report to create a dashboard. To do this, click on the "MyDashboard" tab and select "Pin Live Page" as shown in the following figure. 
[![Figure 9][pic 9]][pic 9]

1. Pin the page to a new dashboard named "Customer Churn Dashboard" as shown in the following figure.
[![Figure 10][pic 10]][pic 10]

1. Pin the remaining 3 tabs using the same approach: Churn Rate Drill Down, Sales Overview, and Machine Learning. 
1. Locate the newly created "Customer Churn Dashboard" under Dashboards group. You can share it with others by clicking on the Share button, as shown in the following figure.
[![Figure 11][pic 11]][pic 11]

Below is an overview of the different reports:

1. The Churn Rate Overview report shows the number of customers in 3 churn risk groups: low risk (no more than 30% churn rate), moderate risk (30% 50% churn rate) and high risk (more than 30% churn rate) on each prediction date. 

1. The Churn Rate Drill Down report shows that two regions Northeast, and Mountain-Prairie have a high percentage of high risk users. Marketing managers in these regions can thus be notified to take churn prevention actions. 

1. The Sales Overview report provides sales information by different dimensions: date, region, and age.

1. The Machine Learning report demonstrates how Azure Machine Learning can help users identify important variables. 

In this dashboard, we used cutoff points 0.3 and 0.5 to generate 3 churn risk groups: low risk, moderate risk, and high risk. These cutoff points can be modified when necessary. The following screen shot shows how this can be done. 

1. Click on the bar chart.
 
1. Click on the Churn Risk variable in the Prediction table.

1. Change the cutoff points and labels.

1. Click on the check mark to confirm the changes.

At this point, you have a working solution that runs the customer churn prediction. Customer behavior patterns may change over time; prediction accuracy can then be improved by retraining the model. Two approaches for retraining the web services are described below: updating manually, and updating through a pipeline every 1 hour.

<a name="retrainmanually"></a>
## Retrain the Predictive Model Manually

<a name="updatablewebservice"></a>
### Modify the Predictive Web Service to allow updates
The default web service endpoint we deployed in the section of "Deploy Azure Machine Learning Predictive Web Service" is associated with the experiment itself. In order to have a updatable endpoint, we need to create an additional service endpoint.

1. Go to https://studio.azureml.net, and choose workspace with the name of your unique string. You can change the workspace by clicking drop-down list on the top right of the web page.
2. On the left sidebar, navigate to the **Web Services** page by clicking the globe icon.
3. Click on "Retail Churn [Predictive Exp.]" (the first web service that you deployed in this tutorial).
3. Click ***Manage endpoints*** at the bottom of the page in the "Additional endpoints" section.
4. On the newly loaded page, click **+New**.
    1. Enter **update** for "Name".
    2. Leave the default values for everything else.
    3. Click **Save**.
5. After the endpoint is created, click the "update" service endpoint.
    1. Click ***Use endpoint*** under the **BASICS** picture. Record the "**Primary key**", "**Batch requests**" (only need to copy up to "jobs") and "**Patch**" in the memo table given below.
    2. Click on the ***API help*** link under the ***Patch*** URI. Record the **Resource Name** in the ***Updatable Resources*** section to the memo table below. (The resource name starts with "Retail Churn Template".) This name will be used in an Azure Data Factory pipeline to update the model.

    | **Updatable Predictive Machine Learning Web Service** |                           |
    | --------------------------- |--------------------------:|
    | apiKey                     | [Primary Key]|
